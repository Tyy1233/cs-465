Architecture
  This application is a Single Page Applications that allows for faster load times and creates mulitple pages. This is defferent from other dynamica pages because this allows for the overall allplication to be run from one application with the assistance of multiple programs. This allows for express to be used to create many functionallity with in the system including the use of Mongo and Angular. 
  The NoSQL data base was used do to the nature of the application and the desire to add and edit the data base with in the back end of the program. This makes it so the data base doesnt need to be coded into the application every time their is a update or addition to the webpage.
Functionality
  Json works with Angular signifcally better and allows for a overall better program to be made of a SPA. 
  
  This project allowed me to understand HTML significantly better and enjoy the coding process. I feel with a lot of research I could create my own webpage with a little practice. This showed me how to create a front end web page and the overall aspects of being able to change things with in the backend of the SPA. This will progress me in the field of web design and development by a significant amount.
